Mirror of Tomorrow - Ethical Engine
-----------------------------------
This module will eventually enforce:
  - safety constraints
  - ethical boundaries
  - self-harm detection
  - harmful-pattern suppression
  - constructive redirection
  - value-aligned guidance

For now, it provides a placeholder interface so the orchestrator
can integrate it later without breaking the pipeline.
