Mirror of Tomorrow - Pattern Engine
-----------------------------------
This module will eventually detect:
  - behavioral patterns
  - linguistic signatures
  - cognitive loops
  - emotional cycles
  - consistency vs. volatility
  - stress/relief oscillations

For now, it provides a placeholder interface so the orchestrator
can integrate it later without breaking the pipeline.
