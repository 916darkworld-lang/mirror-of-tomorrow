Mirror of Tomorrow - Cognitive Engine
-------------------------------------
This module will eventually analyze:
  - reasoning structure
  - cognitive clarity
  - logical coherence
  - self-consistency
  - internal contradictions
  - cognitive load indicators

For now, it provides a placeholder interface so the orchestrator
can integrate it later without breaking the pipeline.
