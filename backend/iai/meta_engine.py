Mirror of Tomorrow - Meta Engine
--------------------------------
This module will eventually:
  - oversee all intelligence engines
  - evaluate engine performance
  - adjust weights dynamically
  - detect anomalies
  - coordinate multi-engine behavior
  - provide meta-level reasoning

For now, it provides a placeholder interface so the orchestrator
can integrate it later without breaking the pipeline.
